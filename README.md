# RPGCharacterBuilder
## My C# Code Louisville Project

#### Application Summary

RPG Character Builder allows the user to create and manage a list of RPG characters. Use the number keys to navigate the menus in order to create, edit, and delete characters. Characters can be created from the main menu. Alternatively, you can view a list of characters, which you can level up (by one, to simulate leveling up in game), equip a weapon, unequip a weapon, or delete.

#### Requirements

RPG Character Builder does not require any special resources other than the ability to run a C# solution. A default characterData.txt is included in the project download, but it can be deleted if you want to start with your own set of characters.
